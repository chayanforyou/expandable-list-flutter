# Expandable List with Add/Delete Functionality in Flutter

This Flutter project demonstrates how to create an expandable list that initially displays a limited number of items, with the option to show more or less using a toggle button. Additionally, it includes functionality for adding new items to the list and deleting individual items.

## Features

- **Expandable List**: The list shows a specified number of items by default, with the option to show the entire list or collapse it.
- **Add New Item**: Add new items to the list dynamically using an "Add" (+) button.
- **Delete Item**: Each list item has a delete button, allowing the user to remove items individually.
- **Toggle View**: A "Show more" button appears when there are more items than initially shown. It toggles to "Show less" when the full list is displayed.

## Customization

- **Change Initial Display Count**: Modify the `itemCount` variable to change how many items are shown by default.
- **Styling**: Customize the appearance of the buttons and list items by modifying the widgets.
